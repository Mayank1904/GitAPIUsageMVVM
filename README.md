# Github-Api-Single-User

- Retrofit

- Koin

- LiveData

 - ViewModel 

- Moshi git push -u origin master

- Coroutines 

- Glide 

- Navigation Component
---------

All of the above have been used with **MVVM architecture** in this project.

Also considering the use of the **Navigation Component** based on single activity.

I have to say that there is a web service by **Github Api** that you can use for (documentation)[https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-single-user]

Hoping to Fork and expand :heart: 

UPDATE 
----
I got the list of repositories !
